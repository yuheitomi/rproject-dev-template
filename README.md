# How to set up

Before building and launching the container based on this template, create cache directories for `renv` and `pak`, as well as RStudio config directory.

```sh
$ mkdir ~/.cache/R/renv-linux # renv
$ mkdir ~/.cache/R/pkgcache-linux # pak
$ mkdir ~/.config/rstudio-linux # rstudio configs
```
